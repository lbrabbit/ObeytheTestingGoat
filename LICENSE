It is a requirement to inherit BY-NC-ND for the the license of these files, as specified in
https://github.com/hjwp/book-example/blob/master/LICENSE

However, as there were a lot of cut-and-paste involved in modifying the files, I cannot claim that the files are strictly ND... I hope 
Harry Percival would mind.
